## Overview ##
This project will be a website that I can refine overtime. It includes most of my history as a person. And gives a pretty good detail about who I am 
as a person. Most imaages and bullet points outside of my skills sections are links that will be opened in a new tab. I was going to add a drop down menu but decided against it due to time. My hopes for this project is that it will serve as my stepping stone into software development.

## Tech Stack ##
For this project I used:

CSS - Styling 

HTML - Formatting

Create React/JS - Formatting

I chose this tech stack because it is the standard in the workplace. Although I didnt add any dynamic controls and complex objects, I wanted to get a taste of what it was like to program with these tools. This is why I wrote formatting for both HTML and JS/React.

Github - Version Control



## License ##
I chose the MIT license. From what I had researched it sounded like the best option in my postion. This is because it is very simple to understad, and does not 
impose significant restrictions on other developers. I also read that it has a good compatibility with other liscenes although I dont yet know exactly what that means.
